# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented using Python's `pygame` library. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features

- **Snake movement**: Control the snake using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Score**: The score increases as the snake eats food. The score is displayed at the top left of the screen.
- **Speed increase**: The snake's speed increases after every 5 pieces of food eaten.
- **Play Again**: After losing the game, the player can press `C` to play again or `Q` to quit the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
 ## Example GamePlay
